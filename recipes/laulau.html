        <p>Lau lau is a Hawaiian dish made of pork and butterfish wrapped in lu'au leaves and ti leaves. Lau lau is steamed and eaten with rice and poi. It's a real treat!</p>

        <h4>Ingrediants</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Lu'au leaves</li>
            <li>Ti leaves</li>
            <li>Pork butt and/or pork belly</li>
            <li>Salted butterfish</li>
            <li>Hawaiian Sea Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cooking instructions</h4>
        <ol>

            <li>First, prep the two types of leaves. LUAU LEAVES: take the luau leaves and wash them thoroughly one by one. Chop off the bottom stem that extends past the bottom of the leaf. Chop that stem into Â½-inch pieces and set aside. TI LEAVES: wash the ti leaves and pat dry. Remove the main/thickest vein that runs through the center of the ti leaf. Removing this vein allows the ti leave to be more pliable/easy to fold as you will be using it to wrap the fillings. Set aside.
            </li>

            <p><li>At a clean workstation, stack 3-5 luau leaves on the counter. Arrange them so that the biggest leaf is on the bottom and the smallest leaf is on top.
            </li></p>

            <li>In the center of the leaf, put in a few chunks of the pork butt and butterfish. Add 2-3 pieces each cubed carrots and purple Okinawan sweet potato, if using. Add several of the chopped luau leaf stems. Sprinkle over Hawaiian sea salt. 
            </li>

            <p><li>Use the luau leaves to fold and wrap all the fillings in a tight bundle.
            </li></p>

            <li>Next, wrap the ti leaves around the luau leaf bundle. Use the ti leaf ends to tie a topknot. If the ends are too short, use a string to tie/secure the bundle.
            </li>

            <p><li>Put the wrapped lau lau in a steamer. Steam for three to four hours till nice and tender. Remove the ti leaf (you can't eat the ti leaf), and serve! Ideally with rice and/or poi, chili pepper water and all your favorite Hawaiian side dishes like lomi lomi salmon and chicken long rice.</li></p>
